@chapter Introduction

@ecl{} is an implementation of the @clisp{} language that was developed
by Giuseppe Attardi's up from the Kyoto Common-Lisp. See @ref{Credits}
for the history of the code you are up to use.

@ecl{} (ECL for short) uses standard C calling conventions for Lisp compiled
functions, which allows C programs to easily call Lisp functions and
vice versa. No foreign function interface is required: data can be exchanged
between C and Lisp with no need for conversion.

@ecl{} is based on a Common Runtime Support (CRS) which provides basic
facilities for memory management, dynamic loading and dumping of binary images,
support for multiple threads of execution.  The CRS is built into a library
that can be linked with the code of the application.  @ecl{} is modular: main
modules are the program development tools (top level, debugger, trace,
stepper), the compiler, and CLOS.  A native implementation of CLOS is available
in @ecl{}: one can configure @ecl{} with or without CLOS.  A runtime version
of @ecl{} can be built with just the modules which are required by the
application.

The @ecl{} compiler compiles from Lisp to C, and then invokes the GNU C
compiler to produce binaries. While former releases of ECL adhere to the
the reference of the language given in @bibcite{Steele:84}, the aim of
@ecl{} is now to achieve maximum compliance with @ansi{}, the most up to
date standard for @clisp{}.

Throughout this manual we will describe the @ecl{} implementation and
how it differs from @bibcite{ANSI} and @bibcite{Steele:84}. In general, as
work in @ecl{} is completed section by section, we will drop compatibility
with @bibcite{Steele:84} and the corresponding chapter will be updated to
document @emph{only} the differences with @bibcite{ANSI}.

@section Credits

The @ecl{} project is an implementation of the @clisp{} language that aims to
comply with the @ansi{} standard. The first ECL implementations were developed
by Giuseppe Attardi's who produced an interpreter and compiler fully conformat
with the Common-Lisp as reported in @cite{Steele:84}. ECL derives itself mostly
from Kyoto @clisp{}, an implementation developed at the Research Institute for
Mathematical Sciences (RIMS), Kyoto University, with the cooperation of Nippon
Data General Corporation.  The main developers of Kyoto @clisp{} were Taiichi
Yuasa and Masami Hagiya, of the Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences,
at Kyoto University.

I must thank Giuseppe Attardi, Yuasa and Hagiya for their wonderful work with
preceding implementations and for putting them in the Public Domain under the
GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation.
Without them this product would have never been possible.

This document is an update of the original ECL documentation, which was based
in part on the material in @bibcite{Yuasa:85}

The following people or organizations must be credited for support in the
development of Kyoto @clisp{}: Prof. Reiji Nakajima at RIMS, Kyoto University;
Nippon Data General Corporation; Teruo Yabe; Toshiyasu Harada; Takashi Suzuki;
Kibo Kurokawa; Data General Corporation; Richard Gabriel; Daniel Weinreb; Skef
Wholey; Carl Hoffman; Naruhiko Kawamura; Takashi Sakuragawa; Akinori Yonezawa;
Etsuya Shibayama; Hagiwara Laboratory; Shuji Doshita; Takashi Hattori.

William F. Schelter improved KCL in several areas and developed Austin Kyoto
@clisp{} (AKCL). Many ideas and code from AKCL have been incorporated in
@ecl{}.

The following is the full list of contributors to ECL: Taiichi Yuasa and
Masami Hagiya (KCL), William F. Schelter (Dynamic loader, conservative Gc),
Giuseppe Attardi (Top-level, trace, stepper, compiler, CLOS, multithread),
Marcus Daniels (Linux port) Cornelis van der Laan (FreeBSD port) David Rudloff
(NeXT port) Dan Stanger, Don Cohen, and Brian Spilsbury.

We have to thank for the following pieces of software that have helped in the
development of @ecl{}
@table @sc
@item Bruno Haible
For the Cltl2-compliance test
@item Peter Van Eynde
For the ANSI-compliance test
@item Symbolic's Inc.

@end table

The @ecl{} project also owes a lot to the people who have tested this program
and contributed with suggestions and error messages: Eric Marsden, Hannu
Koivisto and Jeff Bowden, and others whose name I may have omitted.

@item Obtain the distribution from @uref{http://ecls.sourceforge.net}.
The distribution is in a gzip-compressed tar file named like
@file{ecl.tgz}

@item Prepare a directory (hereafter called @dfn{ECL directory}) for
ECL.  In the following examples, we suppose that the @emph{ECL
directory} is @file{/usr/local/ecl}.

@item  Extract the content from the compressed tar file.
@smallformat
$ zcat ecl.tgz | tar xf -
@end smallformat

@item An auto configuration mechanism allows you to perform a standard
installation with the following commands:
@smallformat
$ ./configure
@end smallformat
This example will prepare to install executable files, manual pages and
info files in standard directories like @file{/usr/local/bin},
@file{/usr/local/man/man1}, @file{/usr/local/info}.

@item If you don't have access rights to these directories, you should
give to configure alternate places.  Try @code{./configure --help} for
instructions on how to supply this information to configure, but
a good starting point is
@smallformat
$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME
@end smallformat

@c FIXME: This information seems wrong!
@c @item Make sure everything went OK with the configuration.
@c The configuration script figures out the machine where it is running and
@c creates a directory @code{machine} where to perform the installation.  If the
@c program fails to recognize the machine, you will have to check whether it is
@c one of the supported machines present in @code{src/h/machine.h}.

@item Next you must build the program and install it
@smallformat
$ make
$ make install
@end smallformat
@end enumerate

At the end of installation, the destination directories will contain
several files. If you have not modified these directories when
invoking @file{configure} the layout should be

@multitable @columnfractions .5 .5
@item @b{Executable files:} @tab 
@item @file{$HOME/bin/ecl}          @tab the @ecl{} interpreter and compiler

@end smallformat

When invoked, @ecl{} will print the banner and initialize the system.  The
date in the @ecl{} banner identifies the revision of @ecl{}.  @code{Version
(0.8) 05/14/1993} is the value of the function
@code{lisp-implementation-version}.

If there exists a file named @file{init.lsp} in the current working directory,
@ecl{} successively evaluates the forms in the file, immediately after the
system initialization.  The user may set up his or her own @ecl{} environment
(e.g., the memory configuration) with @file{init.lsp}.

After the initialization, @ecl{} enters the @dfn{top-level loop} and prints
the prompt `@code{>}'.

@smallformat
Type :h for Help.  Top level.
>
@end smallformat

The prompt indicates that @ecl{} is now ready to receive a form from the
terminal and to evaluate it.

Usually, the current package (i.e., the value of @var{*package*}) is the user
package, and the prompt appears as above.  If, however, the current package is
other than the user package, then the prompt will be prefixed by the package
name.

@smallformat
> (in-package 'cl)
#<"COMMON-LISP" package>
COMMON-LISP> (in-package 'system)
#<"SYSTEM" package>
SYSTEM>
@end smallformat

To exit from @ecl{}, call the function @code{quit}.

@smallformat
>(quit)
Bye.
%
@end smallformat

Alternatively, you may type @myctrl{D}, i.e. press the key @key{D} while pressing
down the control key (@key{Ctrl}).

@smallformat
>@myctrl{D}Bye.
%
@end smallformat

You can disable @myctrl{D} as the exit command by setting to @code{T} the
following variable:
@defvr {System} {*ignore-eof-on-terminal-io*}
This variable controls whether an end of file character (normally @myctrl{D})
should terminate the session. The default value is @nil{}.
@end defvr

The top-level loop of @ecl{} is almost the same as that defined in Section
20.2 of @bibcite{Steele:84}.  Since the input from the terminal is in line
mode, each top-level form should be followed by a newline.  If more than one
value is returned by the evaluation of the top-level form, the values will be
printed successively.  If no value is returned, then nothing will be printed.
@smallformat
>(values 1 2)
1
2
>(values)

>
@end smallformat

When an error is signalled, control will enter the break loop.
@smallformat
>(defun foo (x) (bar x))
foo

>(defun bar (y) (bee y y))
bar

>(foo 'lish)
Error: The function BEE is undefined.
Error signalled by BAR.

Broken at BAR.
>>
@end smallformat

@c @vskip 1em

`@code{>>}' in the last line is the prompt of the break loop.  Like in the
top-level loop, the prompt will be prefixed by the current package name, if the
current package is other than the @code{user} package.

To go back to the top-level loop, type @code{:q}

@smallformat
>>:q

Top level.
>
@end smallformat

@c @vskip 1em

See Section 5.4 for the details of the break loop.

The terminal interrupt (usually caused by typing @myctrl{C} (Control-@code{C}))
is a kind of error.  It breaks the running program and calls the break level
loop.

Example:
@smallformat
>(defun foo () (do () (nil)))
foo

>(foo)
@myctrl{C}
Correctable error: Console interrupt.
Signalled by DO.

Broken at FOO.

@tindexed{Fixnum}'s in @ecl{} are those integers in the range (-2^29)

@node Ratios, Floating-point numbers, Integers, Numbers
@subsection Ratios

There are no implementation-dependent features for ratios.

@node Floating-point numbers, Complex numbers, Ratios, Numbers
@subsection Floating-Point Numbers

@ecl{} supports two floating point formats: @tindexed{single-float} and
@tindexed{double-float}.  These are implemented with IEEE single and double
float arithmetic, respectively.  @code{short-float} is a synonym for
@code{single-float}, and @code{long-float} is a synonym for
@code{double-float}.  The initial value of @vindexed{read-default-float-format}
is @code{single-float}.

Both @code{single-float} and @code{double-float} are represented with a pointer
descriptor, so float operations can cause number consing.  Number consing is
greatly reduced if type declarations are supplied in programs.

An expression such as @code{(eql 1.0s0 1.0d0)} is false, but @code{(eql 1.0f0
1.0d0)} is true.  Similarly, @code{(typep 1.0l0 'short-float)} is false, but
@code{(typep 1.0l0 'double-float}) is true.  For output purposes all
floating-point numbers are assumed to be of @emph{single} or @emph{double}
format.

The floating-point precisions and exponent sizes are:
@multitable {Format} {precision} {exponent}
@item @b{Format} @tab @b{precision} @tab @b{exponent}
@item Short  @tab 24 bits @tab 8 bits
@item Single @tab 24 bits @tab 8 bits
@item Double @tab 53 bits @tab 11 bits

@subsection Standard Characters

@ecl{} supports all standard and semi-standard characters listed in Section
2.2.1 of @bibcite{Steele:84}.  Non-printing characters have the following
character codes.
@multitable {Character} {Code (in octal)}
@item @b{Character}     @tab @b{Code (in octal)}

@item #@back{}Return    @tab  015
@item #@back{}Rubout    @tab  177
@end multitable

Note that @code{#@back{}Linefeed} is synonymous with @code{#@back{}Newline} and
thus is a member of @code{standard-char}.  Other semi-standard characters are
not members of @code{standard-char}.

@node Line divisions, Non-standard characters, Standard characters, Characters
@subsection Line Divisions

Since @ecl{} represents the @code{#@back{}Newline} character by a single code
12, problems with line divisions discussed in Section 2.2.2 of the

@node Non-standard characters, Character attributes, Line divisions, Characters
@subsection Non-standard Characters

@ecl{} supports no additional non-standard characters.


@node Character attributes,  , Non-standard characters, Characters
@subsection Character Attributes

Characters in @ecl{} have no attributes, and thus it lacks the functions and

the lack of extended characters 'base-string and 'simple-base-string are
simple aliases of 'string and 'simple-string.

A string may consists of up to 16777216 (i.e., the value of

All readtables are printed as @code{#<a readtable @var{address}>}.


@node Packages, Pathnames, Readtables, Standards
@section Packages

The following packages are built into @ecl{}.

@multitable {common-lisp-user} {cl-user, user}
@item @b{Name} @tab @b{Nicknames}
@item common-lisp @tab cl, lisp
@item common-lisp-user @tab cl-user, user
@item system @tab si
@item keyword
@end multitable

For instance, the @code{system} package has two nicknames @code{sys} and
@code{si}; @code{system:symbol} may be written as @code{sys:symbol} or
@code{si:symbol}.

Depending on the configuration option by which @ecl{} has been built,
additional packages may be available: @code{compiler}, @code{clos} and
@code{xlib}.

The @code{compiler} package contains symbols used by the @ecl{} compiler.
Other packages are described in Section 11.6 of @bibcite{Steele:84}.  The
@code{clos} package is used for the internal symbols of the @clisp{} Object
System, which is described in Chapter 14.  The @code{xlib} package is used for
the internal symbols of CLX, the @clisp{} Language X Interface to the X Window
System, which is described in a separate manual.

Packages are printed as @code{#<@var{package-name} package>}.


@node Pathnames, Streams, Packages, Standards
@section Pathnames

@ecl{} provides a @code{#} macro @code{#P"} that reads a pathname:
@code{#P"@var{string}"} is equivalent to @code{(pathname "@var{string}"}).  For
example, @code{#P"foo.lsp"} is equivalent to @code{(pathname "foo.lsp")}.
The same format is used when a pathname is printed.

The initial value of the @clisp{} variable
@var{*default-pathname-defaults*} is @code{#P""} (or, equivalently,
@code{(pathname "")}).

A pathname in the file system of @clisp{} consists of six elements:
host, device, directory, name, type and version.

Let me briefly explain how @ecl{} converts a namestring into a
pathname. First @ecl{} tries parsing the namestring using the logical
pathnames syntax, which is as follows
@verbatim
        [hostname:][;][directory-item;]*[name][.type[.version]]
        hostname = word
        directory-item = wildcard-word
	type, name = wildcard-word without dots
	version = NEWEST, newest or a number
@end verbatim
@noindent
Here, @var{word} is a sequence of one or more characters excluding
the @code{#\Null} character and the asterisk `*'. And
@var{wildcard-word} is a sequence of any character excluding
@code{#\Null} and consecutive asterisks (i.e.  @code{"**"} is not
allowed).

If @var{hostname} is not found or it is not a logical hostname, then
@ecl{} tries the physical pathname syntax,
@verbatim
        [device:][[//hostname]/][directory-item/]*[name][.type]
        device, hostname = word
        directory-item, type = wildcard-word
	name = a wildcard-word with maybe a single leading dot
@end verbatim
@noindent
If this syntax also fails, then the namestring is not a valid
pathname string.

It is important to remark that in @ecl{}, all physical namestrings result into
pathnames with a version equal to @code{:NEWEST}. Pathnames which are not
logical and have any other version (i. e. @code{NIL} or a number), cannot
be printed readably, but can produce a valid namestring which results of
ignoring the version.

The following rules apply to both physical and logical namestrings.
First, if a namestring contains one or more periods `.', the last period
separates the namestring into the file name and the filetype.

@verbatim
     "foo.lsp"
         name:          "foo" 
         type:          "lsp"

     "a.b.c" 
         name:          "a.b" 
         type:          "c" 
@end verbatim

If a namestring ends with a period, the filetype becomes the null string.
@verbatim
     "foo." 
          name:          "foo" 
          type:          ""  (null string)
@end verbatim

If a namestring begins with a period, the file name becomes @nil{}.
@verbatim
     ".lsp" 
          name:          nil 
          type:          "lsp" 
@end verbatim

If a namestring contains no period, the filetype is @nil{}.
@verbatim
    "foo" 
          name:          "foo" 
          type:          nil 
@end verbatim

In a pathname, the file directory is represented as a list which
always begins with either @code{:relative} or @code{:absolute}
@verbatim
     "common/demo/foo.lsp" 
     ";common;demo;foo.lsp" 
          directory:     (:relative "common"   "demo") 
          name:          "foo" 
          type:          "lsp" 
     "/common/demo/foo.lsp" 
     "common;demo;foo.lsp" 
          directory:     (:absolute "common"   "demo") 
          name:          "foo" 
          type:          "lsp"
@end verbatim

If a namestring does not contain a directory, the directory component
of the pathname is @nil{}.
@verbatim
     "foo.lsp" 
          directory:     nil 
          name:          "foo" 
          type:          "lsp" 
@end verbatim

The abbreviation symbols `@code{.}' and `@code{..}' may be used in a
namestring, but only the second one is translated to a standard
keyword
@verbatim
     "./demo/queen.lsp" 
          directory:     (:relative "." "demo") 
          name:          "queen" 
          type:          "lsp" 

     "../../demo/queen.lsp" 
          directory:     (:relative @pxlref{:up} :up "demo") 
          name:          "queen" 
          type:          "lsp" 
@end verbatim

The part of a namestring after the last directory separator (`@code{/}'
or `@code{;}') is always regarded as representing the file name and the
filetype.  In order to represent a pathname with both the name and the
filetype @nil{}, end the pathname with a slash. 
@verbatim
     "/usr/common/" 
          directory:     (:absolute "usr" "common") 
          name:          nil 
          type:          nil 

     "/usr/common/.lsp" 
          directory:     (:absolute "usr" "common") 
          name:          ".lsp"
          type:          nil
@end verbatim

`@code{*}' in the place of file name or filetype becomes  @code{:wild}
@verbatim
     "*.lsp" 
          name:          :wild
          type:          "lsp" 

     "foo.*" 
          name:          "foo" 
          type:          :wild 
@end verbatim

@section Random-States

@ecl{} provides a @code{#} macro `@code{#$}' that reads a random state.
@code{#$}@var{integer} is equivalent to @code{(make-random-state
@var{integer})}.  The same format is used when a random state is printed.

There are no implementation-dependent features for structures.


@node Functions, Unreadable data objects, Structures, Standards
@section Functions

All functions in @ecl{} are either compiled into bytecode to be interpreted,
or they are translated into C and then compiled using a native C compiler.
Interpreted functions are printed using the formats
@verbatim
     #<interpreted-function @var{name}>
     #<interpreted-function @code{address}>
@end verbatim
@noindent
Compiled functions (including compiled macro-expansion functions)
are printed in the following formats.
@verbatim
     #<compiled-function @var{name}>
     #<compiled-closure nil>
@end verbatim

The output of @code{(symbol-function @var{fun})} is a list, is either a
function object if @code{'fun} is has a function definition,
@code{(macro . function-object)} if @code{'fun} is a macro, and @code{'special}
if @code{'fun} is a special form.

@ecl{} usually drops the source code of a function unless the global
variable @var{si:*keep-definitions*} was true when the function was
translated into bytecode. Therefore, if you wish to use
@code{#'compile} and @code{#'disassemble} on defined functions, you
should issue @code{(setq si:*keep-definitions* t)} at the beginning of
your session.

@clisp{} constants related to functions have the following values in @ecl{}.
@verbatim
     call-arguments-limit = 64
     lambda-list-keywords = (@optional{} @rest{} @keys{} @allow{}
                               @aux{} &whole &environment &body)

@node Input/Output functions, Network streams, Read macros, Input and output
@section Input and Output Functions

The input and output functions of @ecl{} almost follow the definitions in
Chapter 22 of @bibcite{Steele:84}.  Most of the differences come from the fact
that, in @ecl{}, input from the terminal is always in line mode and binary I/O
is not supported.

In @ecl{}, @code{*terminal-io*} is a two-way stream from the standard input
and to the standard output.  The echoing to the terminal is performed by the
underlying operating system.  In particular, when a disk file is assigned to
the standard output, nothing will be echoed at the terminal.

Those functions that deviate from the definitions in @bibcite{Steele:84} are
listed below.

@defun {load} {@var{pathname} @keys{} :print :verbose :if-does-not-exist}
If @var{pathname} does not specify the filetype of the input file, then load
uses the association list @var{si::*load-search-list*} to find out a suitable
filetype and the function to load it. Typically, this search list is made of
the elements @code{.fas}, @code{.lsp} and @code{.lisp}, in this order. If
everything fails, a file without filetype will be loaded.
@end defun

@defun {open} {}
Streams can only have element type @code{base-char}, @code{(signed-byte 8)}
and @code{(unsigned-byte 8)}. The @code{:external-format} is always @code{:default}.
@end defun

@defun {close} {}
The keyword variable @var{:abort} is always ignored.
@end defun

@defun {listen} {}
This routine requires some low level functions which are not available on
all platforms (For instance on @code{Windows}). When ECL is not able to
determine whether a stream is interactive, @code{listen} returns true unless
an end of file has been previously detected.
@end defun

@defun {clear-input} {}
The functions @code{clear-input} and @code{clear-output} do nothing.
@end defun

@defun {read-char-no-hang} {}
@code{read-char-no-hang} is equivalent to @code{read-char}.
@end defun

The functions @code{princ}, @code{write-char} and @code{write-byte} do not
always flush the stream.  The stream is flushed when
@enumerate
@item a newline character is written, or

@item the input from the terminal is requested in the case that these
functions operate on @code{*terminal-io*}
@end enumerate


@node Network streams, CLOS streams, Input/Output functions, Input and output
@section Network Streams

With a configuration option, the following function is available which opens

integer which identifies the port number to which to connect.  This function
returns a two-way stream which can be used in any of the stream operations.
@end defun

@defun {open-server-stream} {host port}
A stream connected to port number @var{port} is created to which clients can
connect.  This function returns a two-way stream which can be used in any of
the stream operations.
@end defun


@node CLOS streams,  , Network streams, Input and output
@section CLOS Streams

When the optional CLOS subsystem is available, an interface is provided by
@ecl{} for using CLOS objects as @clisp{} input/output character streams.
Such support can be used for instance to build interactive character streams,
which may be used by applications as the stream argument for @clisp{} I/O
functions such as @code{read}, @code{listen}, @code{prin1}, etc.  The
fundamental interface to @code{clos-stream} objects consists of
(generic) functions which implement the basic @clisp{} character stream
operations (see @clisp{}, Chapter 22) but whose details are implementation
dependent.

The following functions are automatically invoked by @ecl{} when a stream
operation involves a CLOS object as a stream parameter. The programmer should
define these methods for any class of objects which are to be used for
character input/output.

Each object is represented by a cell allocated in the heap area of the
interpreter.  The size of the cell is determined by the implementation type of
the object.

The implementation types are classified according to the size of the cells for
the objects of the type, as shown in Table 4-2.  The size of the cells in the
same type class is the same.

managed in a different manner.  The memory space occupied by the body of such
an object is called a @dfn{block}.  A block is either @dfn{contiguous} or
@dfn{relocatable} depending on the area in which it is allocated.  The
difference between the two areas will be explained below.  Table 4-3 lists

Usually, the body of an array, a vector, a bit-vector, or a string is allocated
as a relocatable block.  In @ecl{}, the function @code{make-array} takes an
extra keyword argument @kwd{static}.  If the @kwd{static} argument is supplied
with a non-@nil{} value, then the body of the array is allocated as a
contiguous block.


@node Heap and relocatable areas, The garbage collector, Implementation types, Memory management
@section Heap and Relocatable Areas

The memory space of @ecl{} is divided into two parts: the heap area and the
relocatable area.  Both areas occupy a contiguous space in the memory.

Cells of @ecl{} objects are allocated in the heap.  @ecl{} divides the heap
into pages (1 page = 2048 bytes), and each page consists of cells in the same
type class (see Table 4-2).  Cells in different type classes are allocated in
different pages.  Some blocks are also allocated in the heap: They are called
contiguous blocks.  The pages for contiguous blocks contain only contiguous
blocks.  Thus each page in the heap is either a page for cells in a particular
type class, or a page for contiguous blocks.  Blocks not in the heap are called
relocatable blocks and are allocated in the relocatable area.

The user may specify the maximum number of pages that can be allocated for each
type class by calling the @ecl{} specific function @code{allocate}.  There is
also a limit on the number of pages for contiguous blocks; the limit can be
altered by calling the @ecl{} specific function
@code{allocate-contiguous-pages} size of the relocatable area is specified by
the @ecl{} specific function @code{allocate-relocatable-pages}.  See Section
4.4 for these functions.

In some installations of @ecl{}, the total amount of memory that @ecl{} can
use is limited.  In such cases, the entire memory may become exhausted before
the maximum number of pages for each type class, for contiguous blocks, or for
the relocatable area have been allocated.

The heap lies in a part of memory with lower address than the relocatable area
and there is a ``hole'' between the two areas (see Figure 4-1).  On request for
a new page of heap, the page with the lowest address in the hole is used.  When
the hole is exhausted, the relocatable area is shifted toward the higher
address space and a new hole of an appropriate size is created between the two
areas.

@node The garbage collector, Allocation functions, Heap and relocatable areas, Memory management
@section The Garbage Collector

@ecl{} uses a @emph{conservative garbage collection} technique for collecting
the C stack and a type accurate technique for areas containing Lisp objects.
Scanning conservatively the C stack, looking for potential pointers to Lisp
objects, ensures that no live Lisp objects get collected, even if they are
passed to external procedures in C or some other language.  This approach
greatly simplifies integration of Lisp and C code, since it is not necessary to
protect Lisp object form collection when a foreign function is invoked.

The garbage collector of @ecl{} has three levels according to what it
collects:
@enumerate
@item cells
@item cells and relocatable blocks
@item cells, relocatable blocks and contiguous blocks.
@end enumerate

In levels 2 and 3, the relocatable area is shifted to the higher address space
to reserve an appropriate number of pages in the hole.

For each type class, @ecl{} keeps a free list of unused cells, and when the
free list is exhausted, a new page is allocated, or the garbage collector is
invoked, depending on whether the maximum number of pages for that class have
been allocated or not.

The garbage collector does not compact the heap.  That is, cells and
contiguous blocks are never moved to another place.  Moreover, once a page is
allocated for a particular type class or for contiguous blocks, that page will
never be freed for other classes, even if the entire page becomes garbage.

On the other hand, the relocatable area is compacted during level 2 and
level 3 of garbage collection.  A relocatable block is really relocatable.

The garbage collector is automatically invoked in one of the following
situations.  The number in the parentheses indicates the level of garbage
collection that is performed.

@enumerate
@item  The free list of a certain type class is exhausted
after the maximum number of pages have been allocated for that type class (1).

@item The hole is exhausted (2).

@item The relocatable area is exhausted after the maximum number of
pages have been allocated for the relocatable area (2).

@item The contiguous blocks are exhausted after the maximum number of
pages have been allocated for contiguous blocks (3).
@end enumerate

The garbage collector is also invoked by the following @ecl{} specific
function.

@defun {system} {gc} {x}
The garbage collector is invoked with the level specified by @var{x}.  If
@var{x} is @nil{}, the garbage collector is invoked for level 1 garbage
collection.  If @var{x} is @true{}, it is invoked for level 3 garbage
collection.  Otherwise, it is invoked for level 2 garbage collection.  If
@code{sys:*gc-verbose*} is non-@nil{}, then it print messages at the start and
end of each garbage collection.
@end defun

@defvar{*gc-verbose*}[system] This variable controls whether to print messages
at the start and end of each garbage collection.  If @code{sys:*gc-verbose*} is
@nil{}, @code{gc} fore goes printing any messages.  The default value is @code{T}.
@end defvar


@node Allocation functions, Storage information, The garbage collector, Memory management
@section Allocation Functions
 
The following functions are used to set or inspect the (maximum)
number of pages for each type class, for contiguous blocks, or for
relocatable blocks.

@deffn {extensions} {allocate}  type number
Sets the maximum number of pages for the type class of the implementation type
@var{type} to @var{number}.  If more than @var{number} pages have already been
allocated, an error is signalled.
@end deffn

@deffn {sys} {allocated-pages}  type
Returns the number of pages currently allocated for the type class of the
implementation type @var{type}.
@end deffn

@deffn {sys} {maximum-allocatable-pages}  type
Returns the current maximum number of pages for type class of the
implementation type @var{type}.
@end deffn

@deffn {sys} {allocate-contiguous-pages}  number
Sets the maximum number of pages for contiguous blocks to @var{number}.
@end deffn

@deffn {sys} {allocated-contiguous-pages}  
Returns the number of pages allocated for contiguous blocks.
@end deffn

@deffn {sys} {maximum-contiguous-pages}  
Returns the current maximum number of pages for contiguous blocks.
@end deffn

@deffn {sys} {allocate-relocatable-pages}  number
Sets the maximum number of pages for relocatable blocks to @var{number}.  The
relocatable area is expanded to @var{number} pages immediately.
Therefore,``the current maximum number'' and ``the number of pages allocated''
have the same meanings for relocatable blocks.
@end deffn

@deffn {sys} {allocated-relocatable-pages}  
Returns the number of pages allocated for relocatable blocks.
@end deffn

If the pages for a particular type class are exhausted after the maximum number
of pages for that class have been allocated, and if there remain no free cells
(actually, if there remain very few cells), @ecl{} behaves as directed by the
argument that was initially passed to the @ecl{} specific function @code{(si::ignore-maximum-pages)}.  If the
value is @nil{}, then @ecl{} signals a correctable error and enters the break loop.
The user can reset the maximum number by calling @code{allocate} and then
continue the execution of the program by typing @kwd{r}.

Example:

@smallformat
>(make-list 100000)

Correctable error: The storage for CONS is exhausted.
                   Currently, 531 pages are allocated.
                   Use ALLOCATE to expand the space.
Signalled by MAKE-LIST.

Broken at FUNCALL.
>>(ALLOCATE 'CONS 1000)
t

>>:r

(nil nil nil nil nil nil nil nil nil nil ............
@end smallformat

The user can also reset the maximum number of pages for relocatable blocks and
for contiguous blocks in a similar manner.  On the other hand, if the value of
@code{(si::ignore-maximum-pages)} is non-@nil{}, then @ecl{} automatically
increments the maximum number of pages for the class by 50 percent.  The
initial value of @code{(si::ignore-maximum-pages)} is @true{}.


@node Storage information,  , Allocation functions, Memory management
@section Storage Information
 
@defun {room} {@optional{} x}
The function @code{room} prints the storage information.  The argument
@var{x}  is simply ignored and
the output of @code{room}  is always in the same
format.  @code{room}  prints the following information:
@end defun

@itemize

@item for each type class

@item the number of pages so-far allocated for the type class

@item the implementation types that belong to the type class
@end itemize
@item the number of pages actually allocated for contiguous blocks
@item the maximum number of pages for contiguous blocks
@item the number of times the garbage collector has been called to

@item the total number of pages allocated for cells
@item the total number of pages allocated
@item the number of available pages
@item the number of pages @ecl{} can use.
@end itemize

The number of times the garbage collector has been called is not shown, if the
number is zero.

In the following example, the maximum of @code{531} pages have already been
allocated for the type class to which cons belongs, but only 16.9 percent of
the cells are actually used.  The garbage collector was once invoked to collect
cells in this type class.

@node The tracer, The stepper, Program development, Program development
@section The Tracer

The Tracer causes selected @code{functions} to be traced.  When such a traced
@code{function} is invoked, it prints
@example
  @var{level} > (@var{name   arg1   ...   argn}) 
@end example

On return from a traced @code{function}, it prints
@example
  < @var{level}  (@var{name   value1   ...   valuen})
@end example

@var{name} is the name of the traced @code{function}, @var{args} are the
arguments, and @var{values} are the return values.  @var{level} is a number
which is incremented each time a traced @code{function} is invoked and is
decremented at the completion of the invocation.  Trace print-outs are indented
according to the @var{level}.

In the current version of @ecl{}, macros and special forms cannot be traced.

@defmac {trace} {@{function-name | (function-name @{@keys{} form@}*)@}*}

Causes one or more functions to be traced.  Each @var{function-name} must be a
symbol which is not evaluated.  If a function is called from a compiled
function in the same file, tracing will not be enabled.  If this is the case,
to enable tracing, recompile the caller with a @code{notinline} declaration for
the called function. @code{trace} returns a name list of those functions that
were traced by the call to trace.  If no @var{function-name} is given,
@code{trace} simply returns a name list of all the currently traced functions.

Trace options can cause the normal printout to be suppressed, or cause extra
information to be printed.  Each option is a pair of an option keyword and a
value form. If an already traced function is traced again, any new options
replace the old options.  @var{form} is an expression to be evaluated in an
environment where @var{sys::arglist} is bound to the current list of arguments
to the function.

The following options are defined:

@table @asis
@item @kwd{cond} @var{form}
@item @kwd{cond-before} @var{form}
@item @kwd{cond-after} @var{form}
If @kwd{cond-before} is specified, then @code{trace} does nothing unless
@var{form} evaluates to true at the time of the call.  @kwd{cond-after} is
similar, but suppresses the initial printout, and is tested when the function
returns.  @kwd{cond} tries both before and after.

@item @kwd{step} @var{form}
If @var{form} evaluates to true, the stepper is entered.

@item @kwd{break} @var{form}
@item @kwd{break-after} @var{form}
If specified, and @var{form} evaluates to true, then the debugger is invoked at
the start of the function or at the end of the function according to the
respective option.

@item @kwd{print} @var{form}
@item @kwd{print-after} @var{form}
In addition to the usual printout, the result of evaluating @var{form} is
printed at the start of the function or at the end of the function, according
to the respective option.  Multiple print options cause multiple values to be
@end table
@end defmac

@defmac {untrace} {@{function-name@}*}

Causes the specified functions to be not traced any more.  @var{function-names}
must be symbols and they are not evaluated. @code{untrace} returns a name list
of those functions that were untraced by the call to @code{untrace}.  If no
@var{function-name} is given, @code{untrace} will untrace all the currently
traced functions and will return a list of their names.

@end defmac


@node The stepper, Errors, The tracer, Program development
@section The Stepper

@defmac {step} {form}

Starts evaluating the @var{form} in the single-step mode.  In this mode, before
any form is evaluated, the Stepper will print the form and prompt the user for
a Stepper command.  The Stepper binds the two variables @vindexed{print-level}
and @vindexed{print-length} both to @code{2}, so that the current form may not
occupy too much space on the screen.  A Stepper command will be executed when
the user types the single character for the command followed by the required
arguments, if any, and presses the newline key.  If the user presses the
newline key without having typed any character, then the Stepper will assume
that the Stepper command @code{n} was abbreviated.

@end defmac

The stepper commands are:

@table @asis
@item @code{Newline}
Next.  Evaluates the current form in the single-step mode.

@item @kwd{s}, @kwd{skip}
Skip.  Evaluates the current form in the ordinary mode.  The single-step mode
will be resumed at completion of the evaluation.

@item @kwd{b}, @kwd{back}
Backwards.  Steps back to previous step form.

@item @kwd{pr}, @kwd{print}
Print.  Pretty-prints the current form.

@item @kwd{form}
Form. Return the current form.  Nothing is done, but the current form is
returned as the value of this command.  As a consequence, it is printed by the
top level in the usual way and saved in the variable @code{*}.  The main
purpose of this command is to allow the current form to be examined further by
accessing @code{*}.

@item @kwd{ret}, @kwd{return}
Return. Return without evaluating the current form.

@item @kwd{x}, @kwd{exit}
Exit.  Evaluates the current form and any other forms in the ordinary mode.

@item @code{?}
Help. Lists the commands.
@end table

@node Errors, The break loop, The stepper, Program development
@section Errors

@defvar{*break-enable*}

This variable is used to determine whether to enter the break loop (see Section
5.4) when an error occurs.  Even the function @code{break} checks this
variable.  Initially, this variable is set to @true{}, and thus an error will
invoke the break loop.  If the value is @nil{}, functions that cause fatal
errors, such as @code{ error}, will just print an error message and control
will return to the top-level loop (or to the current break loop, if already in
the break loop).  Functions that cause correctable errors, such as @code{
cerror}, will print an error message and a ``continue message'', and control
will return to the next form.  In @ecl{}, backtrace is not part of an error
message, but a break loop command will print backtrace.  Therefore, if
@vindexed{break-enable} is @nil{}, no backtrace appears on the screen.

When the break loop is entered, @vindexed{break-enable} will be bound to
@nil{}.

@end defvar

@node The break loop, Describe and inspect, Errors, Program development
@section The Break Loop
 
The break loop is a read-eval-print loop similar to the top-level loop.  In
addition to ordinary Lisp forms, the break loop accepts various commands with
which the user can inspect and modify the state of the program execution.  Each
break loop command is identified with a keyword (i.e., a symbol in the
@code{keyword} package).  A break loop command is executed when the user inputs
a list whose first element is the keyword that identifies the command.  The
rest of the list is the arguments to the command.  They are evaluated before
being passed to the command.  If the command needs no arguments, then the user
may input only the keyword.  It is an error if the given keyword does not
identify any command.  Any other input to the break loop is regarded as an
ordinary Lisp form; the form will be evaluated and the resulting values will be
printed on the terminal.

There can be several instances of the break loop at the same time, and each
such instance is identified by a @emph{level number}.  When the break loop is
entered during execution in the top-level loop, the break loop instance is
given the level number 1.  The break loop instance that is entered from the
level @emph{n} break loop is given the level number @var{n}@code{+1}.  The
prompt of the level @emph{n} break loop is @var{n}@code{+1} consecutive
@code{>}'s, occasionally prefixed with the name of the current package.

The break loop keeps track of the invocation sequence of functions (including
special forms and macro expansion functions), which led up to the break loop
from the previous break loop (or from the top-level loop, if the current break
loop is level 1).  The invocation sequence is maintained in a pushdown stack of
@emph{events}.  An event consists of an @emph{event function} and an
@emph{event environment}.  An event function is:
@enumerate
@item an interpreted (i.e., not compiled) function (global function, local function, lambda-expression, or closure), 

@item a special form within an interpreted function, 

@item a macro expansion function called from an interpreted function, 

@item a compiled function called from an interpreted function, or 

@item a compiled function called from another compiled function which
was compiled while the @code{safety} optimize level is 3 or with a
@code{notinline} declaration for the called function (see Chapter 7).
@end enumerate

An event is pushed on the event stack when execution of its event function
begins, and is popped away at the completion of the execution.  An event
environment is the `environment' of the event function at the time the next
event is pushed.  Actually, an event environment is a pointer to the main stack
of @ecl{}.  For each interpreted event function (i.e., event function in
classes 1, 2, and 3), the pointer points to the first entry of the three
contiguous main stack entries that hold the lexical environment of the event
function.  For each compiled event function (i.e., event function in classes 4
and 5), the pointer is set to the first entry of the main stack area that is
used locally by the compiled code.  In most cases, the first argument to the
compiled function is saved in the first entry, the second argument in the
second entry, and so on.  The local variables of the function are allocated in
the entries following the arguments.  However, this is not always the case.
Refer to Section 7.3 for variable allocations in compiled functions.

By break level commands, the user can choose one of the events as the
@emph{current event}.  If the current event function is an interpreted event
function, then the break loop evaluates Lisp forms in the lexical environment
retrieved from the event environment.  In particular, local variables may be
referenced by the variable names, local functions and local macros may be
invoked as usual, established blocks may be exited from, and tags may be used
as the destination of @code{go}.  If the current function is a compiled
function, Lisp forms are evaluated in the null environment.

Within the break loop, each event is represented by the @emph{event symbol}.
The @kwd{backtrace} command, for example, lists events in terms of their event
symbols.  If the event function is a named function (global or local) or a
macro expansion function, then the function or macro name is used as the event
symbol.  If the event function is a special form, then the name of the special
form is used.  If the event function is a lambda-expression (or a closure),
then the symbol lambda (or lambda-closure) is used.

To suppress unnecessary information, the user can hide (or make invisible) some
of the events.  Invisible events do not appear in the backtrace, for example.
Initially, only those events are invisible whose event symbols belong to the
system internal package system.  When the break loop is entered, the last
visible event becomes the current event.

The break loop commands are described below.  Some of the commands allow
abbreviation in the keywords that identify them.  For example, the user may
abbreviate @kwd{current} as @kwd{c}.  The break loop commands return no values
at all.

@deffn {Break Command} {:current}  
@deffnx {Break Command} {:c} {}
Prints the event symbol of the current event.
@end deffn

@deffn {Break Command} {:previous}  @optional{} n
@deffnx {Break Command} {:p} {@optional{} n}
Makes the @var{n}-th previous visible event the
new current event.  Invisible events are not counted.  If there are
less than @var{n} previous events, then the first visible event in the
invocation sequence becomes the new current event. @var{n} must be a
positive integer and the default is @code{1}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Break Command} {:next}  @optional{} n
@deffnx {Break Command} {:n} {@optional{} n}
Makes the @var{n}-th next visible event the
new current event.  If there are less than @var{n} next events,
then the last visible event in the invocation sequence
becomes the new current event. @var{n}  must be a positive integer and the  
default is @code{1}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Break Command} {:backtrace}  
@deffnx {Break Command} {:b} {}
Prints the event symbols of all visible events in order.  The symbol of
the current event is printed
in upper-case letters and the event symbols of other events are in lower-case.
@end deffn

@deffn {Break Command} {:help}  
@deffnx {Break Command} {:h} {}
Lists the break loop commands.
@end deffn

@deffn {Break Command} {:quit}  @optional{} n
@deffnx {Break Command} {:q} {@optional{} n}
Returns control to the level @var{n} break loop.  If @var{n} is 0 or if @var{n}
is omitted, then control will return to the top-level loop. @var{n} must be a
non-negative integer smaller than the current break level.
@end deffn

@deffn {Break Command} {:continue}  
@deffnx {Break Command} {:c} {}
Returns control to the caller of the break loop.  If the break loop has been
entered from @code{cerror}, @code{cerror} returns @nil{} as its value and
control will resume at that point.  Otherwise, this command returns control to
the previous break loop (or to the top-level loop, if the current break level
is @code{1}).
@end deffn

@deffn {Break Command} {:variables}  
@deffnx {Break Command} {:v} {}
Prints the names of the bound variables in the current
environment.  To see the value of a bound variable, just type the
variable name.
@end deffn

@deffn {Break Command} {:functions}  
Prints the names of the local functions and local macros in the current
environment.  To see the definition of a local function or macro, use the
function special form in the usual way.  That is, @code{(function @var{name})}
will return the definition of the local function or macro whose name is
@var{name}.  Local functions and local macros may be invoked as usual.
@end deffn

@deffn {Break Command} {:blocks}  
Prints the names of the blocks established in the current environment.  If a
block @var{block} is established, then the @code{return-from} form
@code{(return-from @var{block value})} works as usual.  That is, the block form
that established @var{block} will return @var{value} as its value and control
will resume at that point.
@end deffn

@deffn {Break Command} {:tags}  
Prints the tags established in the current environment.  If a tag @var{tag} is
established, then the @code{go} form @code{(go @var{tag})} works as usual.
That is, control will resume at the position of @var{tag} in the surrounding
@code{tagbody}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Break Command} {:local}  @optional{} n
@deffnx {Break Command} {:l} {@optional{} n}
If @var{n} is @code{0} or if it is omitted, then this command prints the value
stored in the main stack entry that is pointed to by the current event
environment. @var{n} is an offset from that entry.  If @var{n} is positive,
then the value of the @emph{n}-th next (i.e., toward the top of the main stack)
entry is printed.  If @var{n} is negative, then the value of the @var{n}-th
previous (i.e., toward the bottom of the main stack) entry is printed. @var{n}
must be an integer.  It is an error if the specified entry does not lie between
the bottom and the top of the stack.
@end deffn

@deffn {Break Command} {:hide}  symbol
Hides all events whose event symbol is @var{symbol}.  In particular, by
@code{:hide 'lambda} and @code{hide 'lambda-closure}, all events become
invisible whose event functions are lambda-expressions and closures,
respectively.  If the event symbol of the current event happens to be
@var{symbol}, then the last previous visible event will become the new current
event.  @var{symbol} must be a symbol.

Events of @code{eval} and @code{evalhook} may never become invisible and
attempts to hide them are simply ignored.  It is always the case that the first
event function is either @code{eval} or @code{evalhook}.  Keeping both of them
visible is the simplest way to avoid the silly attempts of the user to hide all
events.
@end deffn

@deffn {Break Command} {:hide-package}  package
Hides all events whose event symbol belongs to the package
@var{package}. @var{package} may be any object that represents a package, i.e.,
a package object, a symbol, or a string.  If the event symbol of the current
event happens to belong to the package @var{package}, then the last previous
visible event will become the new current event.  Even if @code{lisp} package
was specified as @var{package}, events of @code{eval} and @code{evalhook} do
not become invisible.  See the description of @kwd{hide} above.
@end deffn

@deffn {Break Command} {:unhide}  symbol
@kwd{unhide} is the inverse command of @kwd{hide}.  If, however, @var{ symbol}
belongs to one of the @kwd{hide-package}d packages, events of @var{symbol}
become visible only after the package is @code{:unhide-package
'd}. @var{symbol} must be a symbol.
@end deffn

@deffn {Break Command} {:unhide-package}  package
@kwd{unhide-package} is the inverse command of @kwd{hide-package}.  However, an
event whose event symbol belongs to @var{package} becomes visible only after
the symbol is @code{unhide 'd}, if the symbol was @kwd{code 'd}
before. @var{package} may be any object that represents a package, i.e., a
package object, a symbol, or a string.
@end deffn

Example:

@section Describe and Inspect

@defun {describe} {object}
Prints the information about @var{object} to the stream that is the value of
@code{*standard-output*}.  The description of an object consists of several
fields, each of which is described in a recursive manner.  For example, a
symbol may have fields such as home package, variable documentation, value,
function documentation, function binding, type documentation, @code{deftype}
definition, properties.
@end defun

@defun {inspect} {object}
Prints the information about @var{object} in an interactive manner.  The output
of inspect is similar to that of @code{describe}, but after printing the label
and the value of a field (the value itself is not @code{describe 'd}), it
prompts the user to input a one-character command.  The input to @code{inspect}
is taken from the stream that is the value of @code{*query-io*}.  Normally, the
inspection of @var{object} terminates after all of its fields have been
inspected.  The following commands are supported:

@table @asis
@item @code{n}
Next. Goes to the next level; the field is inspected recursively.

@item @code{s}
Skip. Skips the inspection of the field. @code{inspect} proceeds to the next
field.

@item @code{p}
Print. Pretty-prints the field and prompts again.

@item @code{u} @var{form}
Update. The @var{form} is evaluated and the field is replaced by the resulting
value.  If the field cannot be updated, the message @code{Not updated.}  will
be printed.

@item @code{a}
Abort. Aborts the inspection of the current object.  The field and  
the rest of the fields are not inspected.

@item @code{e} @var{form}
Eval. Evaluates the specified form in the null environment and prints the
resulting values.  Then prompts again with the same field.

@item @code{q}
Quit. Aborts the entire inspection.

@item @code{?}
Help. Lists the @code{inspect} commands.

@section The Profiler

The profiler tool is enabled by default in the basic @ecl{} configuration.  It
can be disabled with the @code{configure} option @code{--disable-profiler}.

@deffn {sys} {profile}  @var{grain} @optional{} @var{address}
This function activates the profiling of subsequent executions.  @var{grain} is
a value between 1 and 16384 which indicates the granularity of code segments to
consider. There is a counter for each such segment.  With each clock tick, the
current segment is identified and its corresponding histogram count is
incremented.  A value of 0 for @var{grain} means stop profiling.  @var{address}
indicates the base address for the code being profiled.
@end deffn

@deffn {sys} {display-profile}  
Displays the histogram of accumulated tick counts.  The ticks are attributed to
the compiled Lisp function whose base address is closest to the start of the
segment.  This may not be totally accurate for system functions which invoke
some auxiliary function to do the job.
@end deffn

@deffn {sys} {clear-profile}  
Clears the profile histogram.

@node The interpreter, The compiler, Program development, Top
@chapter The Interpreter

Former versions of @ecl{}, as well as many other lisps, used linked lists to
represent code. As of version 0.3 a bytecode compiler and a bytecode
interpreter were developed to circumvent the limitations of linked lists.

When you enter code at the lisp prompt, or when you load a source file,
@ecl{} begins a process known as minimal compilation. Barely this
process consists on parsing each form, macroexpanding it and translating
it into an intermediate language made of @emph{bytecode}.

The bytecode compiler is implemented in @file{src/c/compiler.d}. The main
entry point is the lisp function @code{SI::MAKE-LAMBDA}, which takes a
name for the function and the body of the lambda lists, and produces a
lisp object that can be invoked. For instance,

@smallformat
> (defvar fun (si::make-lambda 'f '((x) (1+ x))))
*FUN*
> (funcall fun 2)
3
@end smallformat

@ecl{} can only execute bytecode. When a list is passed to @code{EVAL} it
must be first compiled to bytecode and, if the process succeeds, then the
resulting bytecode are passed to the interpreter. Similarly, every time a
function object is created, such as in @code{DEFUN} or @code{DEFMACRO}, the
bytecode compiler processes the lambda form to produce a suitable bytecode
object.

The fact that @ecl{} performs this eager compilation means that changes on
a macro are not immediately seen in code which was already compiled. This has
subtle implications. Take the following code:
@smallformat
> (defmacro f (a b) `(+ ,a ,b))
F
> (defun g (x y) (f x y))
G
> (g 1 2)
3
> (defmacro f (a b) `(- ,a ,b))
F
> (g 1 2)
3
@end smallformat

@noindent
The last statement always outputs @code{3} while in former
implementations based on processing of lambda lists it would produce @code{-1}.


@node The compiler, Declarations, The interpreter, Top
@chapter The Compiler
 
The @ecl{} compiler translates a Lisp program stored in a source file into a C
program, invokes the C compiler to compile the C program, and then generates an
object file, called @emph{fasl file} (or @emph{o-file} because of the actual
filetype).  The compiled program in a fasl file is loaded by the function
@code{load}.

Ordinarily, the object program generated by the @ecl{} compiler scarcely does
runtime error-checking for runtime efficiency.  In addition, Lisp functions in
the same source file are linked together and some system functions are
open-coded in-line.  To control runtime error checking, supply appropriate
@code{optimize} declarations (see Section 7.1).

The @ecl{} compiler processes the @code{eval-when} special form exactly as
specified in @bibcite{Steele:84} (see Section 5.3.3 of @bibcite{Steele:84}).

The @ecl{} compiler is invoked by the functions @code{compile-file},
@code{compile}, and @code{disassemble} described below.  In addition, the
@ecl{} compiler may be invoked directly by the Shell commands @code{ecl}.
This command requires the file name of the source file as its
argument. @code{ecl} simply adds @code{.lsp} to the file name argument to
obtain the full name of the source file.

@smallformat
        $ ecl @var{filename}
@end smallformat

@noindent
has the same effect as the compiler invocation @code{(compile-file
@var{filename})} from within @ecl{}, and

@smallformat
        $ ecl -C @var{filename}
@end smallformat

has the same effects as @code{(compile-file @var{filename}
:c-file t :h-file t :data-file t)}.

@defun {compile-file} {@var{pathname} @keys{} :output-file :verbose :print :c-file :h-file :data-file}
@code{compile-file} compiles the Lisp program stored in the file specified by
@var{pathname}, and generates a binary file.  If @kwd{verbose} is true, a
message indicating what file is being compiled is printed.  If @kwd{print}
is true, information about top-level forms in the file being compiled is
printed.  @code{compile-file} generates the following temporary files:

@multitable {Temporary File} {The include file referenced in the c-file}
@item @b{Temporary File}
@tab @b{Contents}
@item @var{c-file}
@tab C version of the Lisp program
@item @var{h-file}
@tab The include file referenced in the c-file
@item @var{data-file}
@tab The Lisp data to be used at load time
@end multitable

If files of these names already exist, the old files will be deleted first.
Usually, these intermediate files are automatically deleted after execution of
@code{compile-file}.

The input-file is determined in the usual manner (see Section 2.9), except
that, if the filetype is not specified, then the default filetype @code{.lsp}
will be used.  The keyword parameter @code{:output-file} defines the default
directory and the default name to be applied to the output files (i.e., the
fasl file and the temporary files).  @kwd{output-file} itself defaults to
@var{input-pathname}.  That is, if @kwd{output-file} is not supplied, then the
directory and the name of the input file will be used as the default directory
and the default name for the output files.  The file types of the output files
are fixed as follows.

@multitable {@b{Output File}} {@b{Filetype}}
@item @b{Output File} @tab @b{Filetype}
@item fasl file @tab @code{.o}
@item c-file @tab @code{.c}
@item h-file @tab @code{.h}
@item data-file @tab @code{.data}
@end multitable

Each output file can be specified by the corresponding keyword parameter.
If the value of the keyword parameter is @nil{}, then the output file will be
deleted after execution of @code{compile-file}.  If the value of the
keyword parameter is @true{}, then the output file will be left in the
default directory under the default name.  Otherwise, the output file will
be left in the directory under the name specified by the keyword parameter.
The default value of @kwd{output-file} is @true{}, and the default values
of @kwd{c-file}, @kwd{:h-file}, and @kwd{data-file} are all @nil{}.

@table @code
@item (compile-file 'foo) 
The source file is @code{FOO.lsp} and the fasl file is @code{FOO.o}
both in the current directory.

@item (compile-file 'foo.lish) 
The source file is @code{FOO.LISH} and the fasl file is @code{FOO.o}'.

@item (compile-file "/usr/mas/foo" :output-file "/usr/tai/baa") 
The source file is @code{foo.lsp} in the directory @file{/usr/mas}, and the
fasl file is @code{baa.o} in the directory @file{/usr/tai}.
@end table
@end defun

@defun {compile} {@var{name} @var{code} @optional{} @var{definition}}
If @var{definition} is not supplied, @var{name} should be the name of a
not-yet-compiled function.  In this case, compile compiles the function,
replaces the previous definition of @var{name} with the compiled
function,@emph{and} returns @var{name}.  If @var{definition} is supplied, it
should be a lambda-expression to be compiled and @var{name} should be a symbol.
If @var{name} is a non-@nil{} symbol, then compile installs the compiled
function as the function definition of @var{name} and returns @var{name}.  If
@var{name} is @nil{}, then compile simply returns the compiled function.

The @ecl{} compiler is essentially a file compiler, and forms to be
compiled are supposed to be stored in a file.  Thus compile actually
creates a source file which contains the form designated by the
arguments.  Then compile calls @code{compile-file} to get a fasl file,
which is then loaded into @ecl{}.  The source file and the fasl file
are given the names @file{gazonk.lsp} and @file{gazonk.fasl},
respectively.  These files are not deleted automatically after the
execution of @code{compile}.

@end defun

@defun {disassemble} {@optional{} @var{thing} @keys{} :h-file :data-file}

This function does not actually disassemble.  It always calls the @ecl{}
compiler and prints the contents of the c-file, i.e., the C-language code,
generated by the @ecl{} compiler.  If @var{thing} is not supplied, or if it is
@nil{}, then the previously compiled form by disassemble will be compiled
again.  If @var{thing} is a symbol other than @nil{}, then it must be the name
of a not-yet-compiled function, whose definition is to be compiled.  In this
case, it is an error if the name is associated with a special form or a macro.
If @var{thing} is a lambda-expression @code{(lambda @var{lambda-list .
body})}, then @code{disassemble} first creates a function definition
@code{(defun gazonk @var{lambda-list .  body})} and this definition is
compiled.  (The function name @code{gazonk} has no special meanings.  Indeed,
the displayed code is essentially independent of the function name.)
Otherwise, @var{thing} itself will be compiled as a top-level form.  In any
case, @code{disassemble} does not install the compiled function.
@code{disassemble} returns no value.

No intermediate h-file is created if the keyword parameter @code{:h-file} is
@nil{} or if @kwd{h-file} is not supplied.  Otherwise, an intermediate h-file
is created under the name specified by @kwd{h-file}.  Similarly, the
intermediate data-file is specified by the keyword parameter @kwd{data-file}.

@end defun


@node Declarations, OS interface, The compiler, Top
@chapter Declarations

@ecl{} supports all kinds of declarations described in the
@bibcite{Steele:84}.  Any valid declaration will affect the @ecl{} environment
in some way or another, although information obtained by declarations, other
than special declarations, is mainly used by the @ecl{} compiler.

As described in @bibcite{Steele:84}, @clisp{} declarations are divided into two
classes: @var{proclamations} and others.  A proclamation is a global
declaration given by the function @code{proclaim}, the top-level @emph{macro}
@code{defvar}, or the top-level macro @code{defparameter}.  Once given, a
proclamation remains effective during the @ecl{} session unless it is shadowed
by a local declaration or is canceled by another proclamation.  Any other
declaration is a @emph{local declaration} and is given only by the special form
@code{declare}.  A local declaration remains in effect only within the body of
the construct that surrounds the declaration.

In the following nonsensical example borrowed from Chapter 9 of
@bibcite{Steele:84},
@lisp
(defun nonsense (k x z)
   (foo z x)
   (let ((j (foo k x))
         (x (* k k)))
        (declare (inline foo) (special x z))
     (foo x j z)))
@end lisp
@noindent
the @code{inline} and the special declarations both remain in effect within the
surrounding @code{let} form.  In this case, we say that the @code{let} form is
the @emph{surrounding construct} of these declarations.

@defspec {the} {@var{value-type form}}

The @ecl{} interpreter does actually check whether the value of the
@emph{form} conforms to the data type specified by @emph{value-type} and
signals an error if the value does not.  The type checking is performed by
the function @code{typep}.  For example,
@end defspec

@lisp
(the fixnum (foo))
@end lisp

@noindent
is equivalent to

@lisp
(let ((values (multiple-value-list (foo))))
   (cond ((endp values) (error ``Too few return values."))
         ((not (endp (cdr values)))
          (error ``Too many return values."))
         ((typep (car values) 'fixnum) (car values))
         (t (error ``~s is not of type fixnum." (car values)))))
@end lisp

On the other hand, the @ecl{} compiler uses the special form to
obtain type information for compiled code optimization. No code for
runtime type-checking is embedded in the compiled code.

@section Declaration Specifiers

@ecl{} recognizes all declaration specifiers defined in @bibcite{Steele:84}.
The syntax of each such declaration specifier is exactly the same as defined in
@bibcite{Steele:84}.  In addition, @ecl{} recognizes the @code{object}
declaration specifier which is specific to @ecl{}.

@deffn {Declaration} {special}  @{@var{variable-name}@}*
The interpreter and the compiler of @ecl{} both treat special declarations
exactly as described in @bibcite{Steele:84}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Declaration} {type}  @var{type} @{@var{variable-name}@}*
A @code{type} proclamation @code{(type @emph{type var1 var2} ...)}  specifies
that the dynamic values of the named variables are of the type @emph{type}.  A
local @code{type} declaration specifies that the variables mentioned are bound
by the surrounding construct and have values of the type @emph{type} during
execution of the surrounding construct.  The compiler issues a warning if one
of the named variables is not bound by the surrounding construct.  The
information given by @code{type} declarations is used by the compiler to
optimize the compiled code.  The behavior of the compiled code is unpredictable
if a wrong @code{type} declaration is supplied.  The compiler detects certain
wrong @code{type} declarations at compile time.
@end deffn

For example,
@smallformat
>(defun foo (x y)
   (declare (fixnum x) (character y))
   (setq x y)
  ...))
foo

>(compile 'foo)

; (defun foo ...) is being compiled.
;; Warning: Type mismatches between x and y.
@end smallformat

See Section 7.3 for further information on @code{type} declarations.

@deffn {Declaration} {type}  @{@var{variable-name}@}*
(@var{type var1 var2} ...) is equivalent to @code{(type @var{type var1 var2}
...)}, provided that @var{type} is one of the symbols in Table 4-1 of
@bibcite{Steele:84}, other than @code{function}.  Declaration specifications
that begin with @code{function} are regarded as @code{function} declarations
(see below).
@end deffn

@deffn {Declaration} {function}  @var{function-name} @var{argument-types} . @var{return-types}
A @code{function} declaration is used to obtain type information for function
call forms.  That is, a @code{function} declaration specifies the argument and
the return types of each form that calls the named function.
@end deffn

@lisp
(defun foo ()
  (declare (function bar (character) fixnum))
  (+ (bar (atcholi1)) (bar (atcholi2))))
@end lisp

In this example, the @code{function} declaration specifies that the two
functions @code{atcholi1} and @code{atcholi2} both return character objects
when called within the body of @code{foo}, and that the function bar returns
fixnum objects when called within the body of @code{foo}.  The type information
given by function declarations is used by the compiler to optimize the compiled
code.  The behavior of the compiled code is unpredictable if a wrong
@code{function} declaration is supplied.  The compiler detects certain wrong
@code{function} declarations at compile time.

For example,

@smallformat
>(defun foo (x)
   (declare (fixnum x)
            (function bar (character) fixnum))
   (bar x))
foo

>(compile 'foo)

; (defun foo ...) is being compiled.
;; Warning: The type of the form x is not character.
@end smallformat

However, the compiler does not check the number of arguments, and thus, the
following function definition will be compiled successfully without any
warnings.

@lisp
(defun foo ()
  (declare (function bar (character character) fixnum))
  (+ (bar (atcholi1)) (bar (atcholi2) (atcholi3) (atcholi4))))
@end lisp

For this definition, the compiler assumes that the three functions
@code{atcholi1}, @code{atcholi2}, and @code{atcholi3} will return fixnum
objects.  The return type of @code{atcholi4} is unknown at compile time.

The complete syntax of a function declaration is:

@example
(function  function-name
  (@{type@}* [@{@optional{} | @rest{} | @keys{}@} @{thing@}*])
  @{(values @{type@}* ) | @{type@}*@}
)
@end example

Although @optional{}, @rest{}, and @keys{} markers may appear in the list of
argument types, only those @var{types} are recognized that appear before any
such markers and the rest of the list is simply ignored.  Note that functions
with @optional{}, @rest{}, or @keys{} parameters may still be declared by
@code{function} declarations because of the use of @code{function} declarations
mentioned above.

The @code{values} construct in the specification of return types is almost
useless: @code{(function @var{function-name argument-types} (@var{values}
@var{type1 type2} @dots{}))} is equivalent to @code{(function
@var{function-name argment-types type1 type2} @dots{})}.

See Section 7.3 for further information on @code{function} declarations.

@deffn {Declaration} {ftype}  @var{function-type} @{@var{function-name}@}*
@var{function-type} must be a list whose first element is the symbol
@code{function}.  @code{(ftype (function . @var{rest}) @var{function-name-1}
...  @var{function-name-n})} is equivalent to @var{n} consecutive
@code{function} declarations @code{(function @var{function-name-1}
. @var{rest})} ... @code{(function @var{function-name-n} . @var{rest})}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Declaration} {notinline}  @{function-name@}*
@code{(notinline @var{function1 function2} ...)}  specifies that the
compiler should not compile the named functions in-line.  Calls to the
named functions can be traced and an event (see Section 5.4) is pushed
on the event stack when any one of the named functions is invoked.
@end deffn

@deffn {Declaration} {inline}  @{function-name@}*
An @code{inline} proclamation cancels currently effective @code{notinline}
proclamations, and a local @code{inline} declaration locally shadows currently
effective @code{notinline} declarations.
@end deffn

@smallformat
>(defun foo (x)
   (cons (car x)
         (locally (declare (inline car)) (car x))))
foo
>(defun bar (x)
   (cons (car x)
         (locally (declare (inline car)) (car x))))
foo
>(proclaim '(notinline car))
nil
>(compile 'foo)
...
>(proclaim '(inline car))
nil
>(compile 'bar)
...
@end smallformat

Usually, primitive functions such as @code{car} are compiled in-line.
Therefore, in this example, only the first call to @code{car} within @code{foo}
is compiled not in-line.

In general, the @ecl{} compiler compiles functions in-line whenever possible.
Thus an @code{inline} declaration @code{(inline @var{function1 function2} ...)}
is worthless if none of the named functions have previously been declared to be
@code{notinline}.

@deffn {Declaration} {ignore}  @{variable-name@}*
Usually, the compiler issues a warning if a lexical variable is never referred
to.  @code{(ignore @var{var1 ...  varn})} causes the compiler not to issue a
warning even if the named variables are never referred to.  The compiler issues
a warning if one of the named variables is not bound by the surrounding
construct, or if a named variable is actually referred to.  @code{ignore}
proclamations are simply ignored.
@end deffn

@deffn {Declaration} {optimize}  @{(quality value) | quality@}*
@ecl{} supports the four @code{optimize} qualities listed in the
@bibcite{Steele:84}.

@code{speed} and @code{compilation-speed} are used to set up the optimization
switch of the C language compiler which is invoked to compile the C-language
code generated by the @ecl{} compiler (see Chapter 6).  @code{(optimize (speed
@var{n}))} and @code{(optimize (compilation-speed @var{m}))} are equivalent,
where @var{n} and @var{m} are integers between 0 and 3, and @var{m} is equal to
3-@var{n}.  When a @ecl{} session is started, the @code{speed} quality is set
to 3.  That is, by default, the compiler generates the fastest code in the
longest compilation time.  The @code{space} quality specifies whether the code
size is important or not: The compiled code is a little bit larger and faster
when compiled with the space quality 0, than when compiled with the space
quality 1, 2, or 3.  When a @ecl{} session is started, the @code{space}
quality is set to 0.  The @code{safety} quality determines how much runtime
error checking code should be embedded in the compiled code.  If the
@code{safety} quality is 0, the compiled code scarcely does runtime error
checking.  If the @code{safety} quality is 1, then the compiled code for a
function will check the number of arguments to the function at runtime.  If the
@code{safety} quality is 2 or 3, then the compiled code does full runtime error
checking.  In addition, the highest quality value 3 causes the compiler to
treat all functions as if they were declared to be @code{notinline}.  When a
@ecl{} session is started, the @code{safety} quality is set to 0.

@node Type specifiers, Type declarations, Declaration specifiers, Declarations
@section Significant Type Specifiers

Whenever a declaration is encountered, each type specifier (if any) in the
declaration is converted to one of the following type specifiers, which are
collectively called the @emph{significant type specifiers}.
@verbatim
          |------------   fixnum
          |------------   character
          |------------   short-float
          |------------   long-float
      t --|----   (array t)  --------------  (vector t)
          |----   (array fixnum)  ---------  (vector fixnum)
          |----   (array string-char)   ---  string
          |----   (array short-float)   ---  (vector short-float)
          |----   (array long-float)    ---  (vector long-float)
          |----   (array bit)   -----------   bit-vector
@end verbatim

Here, the lines indicate subtype relations; the right type is a subtype of the
left type.  For instance, @code{(vector t)} is a subtype of @code{(array t)}
and @true{}, and @code{(array t)} itself is a subtype of @true{}.  However,
@code{(array t)} and @code{(array string-char)} are disjoint types.

The function @code{subtypep} is used for the conversion to significant type
specifiers: If the first value of @code{(subtypep @var{raw-type type})} is
@true{} for one of the significant type specifiers @var{type}, then the type
specifier @var{raw-type} in the declaration is converted to @var{type}.  If
there are more than one such significant type specifiers, then the type
specifier that is a subtype of other specifiers is selected.  For example, type
specifiers @tindexed{fixnum}, @code{(mod 3)}, and @code{(member 0 1)} are all
converted to @tindexed{fixnum}, though they are also subtypes of @true{}.

Because of this type specifier conversion, @ecl{} may sometimes regard two
seemingly distinct declarations as the same.  For example, the following
@code{type} declarations are completely equivalent, internally in @ecl{}.

@lisp
(declare (type fixnum x)))

(declare (type (mod 3) x))

(declare (type (member 0 1) x))
@end lisp

Type specifiers in declaration specifications passed to the @ecl{} specific
function @code{proclamation} are also converted to significant type specifiers.
Thus, for example,

@smallformat
>(proclaim '(function foo (fixnum) fixnum))
nil
>(proclamation '(function foo ((mod 3)) (member 0 1)))
t
>(proclamation '(function foo (number) character))
nil
@end smallformat

The first call to @code{proclamation} returns @true{} because both @code{(mod
3)} and @code{(member 0 1)} are converted to @tindexed{fixnum} before the
function type of @code{foo} is checked.


@node Type declarations, Variable allocations, Type specifiers, Declarations
@section Treatment of Type Declarations

@ecl{} uses several runtime stacks.

Arguments to functions, lexical and temporary variables are allocated on the C
stack. Temporary values saved on the C stack may sometimes be represented as
@var{raw data} instead of pointers to heap-allocated cells.  Accessing such raw
data on the C stack results in faster compiled code, partly because no pointer
dereferencing operation is necessary, and partly because no cell is newly
allocated on the heap when a new object is created. This is particularly
helpful for numeric code which computes with floating point numbers.

@ecl{} uses a conservative garbage collector to scan the C stack and find
references to live object.

@node Variable allocations, Raw data functions, Type declarations, Declarations
@section Variable Allocations

If a lexical variable is declared to be of @tindexed{fixnum}, @code{character},
@code{short-float}, @code{long-float}, or their subtypes, then it is allocated
on the C stack rather than on the value stack.  In addition, the variable
always has a raw datum as its value: 32 bit signed integer for fixnums, 8 bit
character code with 24 bit padding for characters (remember that the font and
bit fields of @ecl{} characters are always 0), 32 bit floating point
representation for short-floats, and 64 bit floating point representation for
long-floats.  Similarly, if a lexical variable is named in an @code{object}
declaration (see Section 7.1), then it is allocated on the C stack but, in this
case, the variable always has a cell pointer as its value.  The user is
strongly recommended to make sure that objects stored in such an @code{object}
variable may never be garbage collected unexpectedly.  For example,

@lisp
(do ((x (foo) (cdr x)))
    ((endp x))
    (let ((y (car x)))
         (declare (object y))
      (bar y)))
@end lisp

@noindent
this @code{object} declaration is completely safe because the value of the
variable @var{y} is always a substructure of the value of @var{x}, which in
turn is protected against garbage collection.  Incidentally, loop variables of
@code{dolist} may always be declared as object variables, since the
@code{dolist} form has essentially the same control structure as the @code{do}
form above.  On the other hand, the result of evaluation of the following form
is unpredictable, because the cons cell pointed to from the @code{object}
variable @var{z} may be garbage collected before @code{bar} is called.

@lisp
(let ((z (cons x y)))
     (declare (object z))
  (foo (cons x y))
  (bar z))
@end lisp

Lexical variables that are not declared to be of @tindexed{fixnum},
@tindexed{character}, @tindexed{short-float}, @tindexed{long-float}, or their
subtypes, and that are not named in @code{object} declarations are usually
allocated on the value stack, but may possibly be allocated on the C stack
automatically by the compiler.


@node Raw data functions, Arguments/Values passing, Variable allocations, Declarations
@section Built-in Functions that Operate on Raw Data Directly
 
Some built-in @clisp{} functions can directly operate on raw data, if
appropriate declarations are supplied.  The addition function @code{+} is among
such functions.

@lisp
(let ((x 1))
     (declare (fixnum x))
  ...
  (setq x (+ x 2))
  ...
  )
@end lisp

In the compiled code for this @code{let} form, the raw fixnum datum (i.e., the
32 bit signed integer) stored in @var{x} is simply incremented by 2 and the
resulting 32 bit signed integer is stored back into @var{x}.  The compiler is
sure that the addition for 32 bit signed integers will be performed on the call
to @code{+}, because the arguments are both fixnums and the return value must
be also a fixnum since the value is to be assigned to the @tindexed{fixnum}
variable.  The knowledge of both the argument types and the return type is
necessary for this decision: Addition of two fixnums may possibly produce a
bignum and addition of two bignums may happen to produce a fixnum value.  If
either the argument type or the return type were not known to the compiler, the
general addition function would be called to handle the general case.  In the
following form, for example, the compiler cannot be sure that the return value
of the multiplication is a fixnum or that the arguments of the addition are
fixnums.

@lisp
(setq x (+ (* x 3) 2))
@end lisp

In order to obtain the optimal code, a @code{the} special form should
surround the multiplication.

@lisp
(setq x (+ (the fixnum (* x 3)) 2))
@end lisp

Built-in @clisp{} functions that can directly operate on raw data are:

@enumerate
@item arithmetic functions such as @code{+},  @code{-},
@code{1+}, @code{1-},  @code{*}, @code{floor},  @code{mod}, @code{/}, and
@code{expt}.

@item predicates such as @code{eq}, @code{eql}, @code{equal},
@code{zerop}, @code{plusp}, @code{minusp}, @code{=}, @code{/=}, @code{<},
@code{<=}, @code{>}, @code{>=}, @code{char=}, @code{char/=}, @code{char<},
@code{char<=}, @code{char>}, and @code{char>=}.

@item sequence processing functions that receive or return one or more
fixnum values, such as @code{nth}, @code{nthcdr}, @code{length}, and
@code{elt}.

@item array access functions such as @code{svref}, @code{char}, @code{schar},
and @code{aref} (see below).

@item system-internal functions for array update (see below).
 
@item type-specific functions such as @code{char-code}, @code{code-char},
and @code{float}.
@end enumerate

As mentioned in Section 2.5.1, array elements are represented in one of six
ways depending on the type of the array.  By supplying appropriate array type
declarations, array access and update operations can handle raw data stored in
arrays.  For example,

@lisp
(let ((a (make-array n :element-type 'fixnum))
      (sum 0))
     (declare (type (array fixnum) a)
              (fixnum sum))
  (dotimes (i n)             ;;; Array initialization.
           (declare (fixnum i))
     (setf (aref a i) i))
  ....
  (dotimes (i n)             ;;; Summing up the elements.
           (declare (fixnum i))
     (setq sum (+ (aref a i) sum)))
  ....
  )
@end lisp

The @code{setf} form replaces the @code{i-th} element of the array a by the raw
fixnum value of @code{i}.  The @code{aref} form retrieves the raw fixnum datum
stored in @code{a}.  This raw datum is then added to the raw fixnum value of
the fixnum variable @code{sum}, producing the raw fixnum datum to be stored in
@code{sum}.  Similar raw data handling is possible for arrays of types
@code{(array fixnum), (vector fixnum),
 (array string-char),  string,
 (array short-float),  (vector short-float),
 (array long-float)}, and @code{(vector long-float)}.

@node Arguments/Values passing,  , Raw data functions, Declarations
@section Arguments/Values Passing

Function proclamations @code{(function @var{function-name} (@var{arg-type1}
@var{arg-type2} ...) @var{return-type})} or its equivalents give the compiler
the chance to generate compiled code so that arguments to the named functions
and resulting values of the named functions will be passed via the C stack,
thus increasing the efficiency of calls to these functions.  Such
arguments/values passing via the C stack is possible only if the called
function is also defined in the same source file.  This is because the code for
the called function must have two entries: One entry for C arguments/values
passing and another for ordinary Lisp arguments/values passing.  (An ordinary
function has only the latter entry.)  When the latter entry is used, the
arguments are @emph{unboxed} and passed to the former entry.  On return from
the function, the resulting value is cast into a Lisp data type.

A good example of this follows.

@lisp
(eval-when (compile)
  (proclaim '(function tak (fixnum fixnum fixnum) fixnum)))

(defun tak (x y z)
  (declare (fixnum x y z))
  (if (not (< y x))
      z
      (tak (tak (1- x) y z)
           (tak (1- y) z x)
           (tak (1- z) x y))))

;;; Call (tak 18 12 6).
@end lisp

When @code{tak} is called with the arguments @code{18, 12}, and @code{6}, the
raw fixnum data of the arguments are set to the parameters @code{x}, @code{y},
@code{z}.  After that, only raw C data are used to perform the execution: No
cell pointers are newly allocated nor even referenced.  The built-in functions
@code{<} and @code{1-} directly operate on the raw data.  Only at the return from
the top-level call of @code{tak}, the resulting raw data value (which happens
to be @code{7}) is reallocated on the heap.  Note that both the @code{function}
proclamation and the local @tindexed{fixnum} declaration are necessary to
obtain the optimal code.  The @code{function} proclamation is necessary for
arguments/values passing via the C stack and the @tindexed{fixnum} declaration
is necessary to unbox the parameters into C variables.

@var{exit-code} must be an integer and its default value is @code{0}.
@end defun

@node Macros, CLOS, OS interface, Top
@chapter Macros

A @dfn{defmacro lambda-list} is a lambda-list-like construct that is used as
the third element in the @code{defmacro} form,
@example
(defmacro @var{name} @var{efmacro-lambda-list} [@var{declaration} | @var{doc-string}] @{@var{form}@}*)
@end example

The description of defmacro lambda-lists in @bibcite{Steele:84} is quite
ambiguous.  @ecl{} employs the following syntax.

The complete syntax of a defmacro lambda-list is:

@example
( [&whole @var{var}]
  [&environment @var{var}]
  [@var{pseudo-var}]
  [@optional{} @{var | ( pseudo-var [initform [pseudo-var]] )@}]
  @{[@{@rest{} | &body@} pseudo-var]
   [@keys{} @{var
          | (@{var | (keyword pseudo-var)@} [initform [pseudo-var]])@}*
    [@allow{}]]
   [@aux{} @{var | (pseudo-var [initform])@}*]
   | . var @}
)
@end example

@noindent
where @var{pseudo-var} is either a symbol or a list of the following
form:

@example
( @{pseudo-var@}*
  [@optional{} @{var | (pseudo-var [initform [pseudo-var]])@}*]
  @{[@{@rest{} | &body@} pseudo-var]
   [@keys{} @{var | (@{var | (keyword pseudo-var)@} 
                  [initform [pseudo-var]])@}*
    [@allow{}]]
   [@aux{} @{var | (pseudo-var [initform])@}]
  | . var @}
)
@end example

The defmacro lambda-list keyword @code{&whole} may appear only at the
top-level, first in the defmacro lambda-list.  It is not allowed within
@var{pseudo-var}.  Use of the @code{&whole} keyword does not affect the
processing of the rest of the defmacro lambda-list:

@lisp
(defmacro foo (&whole w x y) ...)
@end lisp
and
@lisp 
(defmacro foo (x y) ...)
@end lisp

@noindent
both bind the variables @code{x} and @code{y} to the second and the
third elements, respectively, of macro forms of @code{foo}.

The defmacro lambda-list keyword @code{&environment} may appear only at the
top-level, first in the defmacro lambda-list if @code{&whole} is not supplied,
or immediately after the variable that follows @code{&whole}, if @code{&whole}
is supplied.  @code{&environment} is not allowed within @var{pseudo-var}.  Like
@code{&whole}, use of @code{&environment} does not affect the processing of the
rest of the defmacro lambda-list.  If an @code{&environment} parameter is
supplied and if this parameter is not used at all, then the @ecl{} compiler
will issue a warning.  To suppress the warning, just remove the parameter from
the defmacro lambda-list, or add an @code{ignore} declaration.
 
The defmacro lambda-list keyword @code{&body} is completely equivalent to the
@rest{} keyword.  @ecl{} takes no special action for @code{&body} parameters.

Although useless, @ecl{} allows supplied-p parameters to be destructured.
This is useless because supplied-p parameters can never be bound to a non-empty
list.  Our intention is to stick to the specification in the
@bibcite{Steele:84} as far as possible, even if it is silly to do so.

Like for ordinary lambda-lists, the interpreter detects invalid arguments to
macro expansion functions.  When a parameter is destructured, the structure of
the corresponding argument is also checked.  Such runtime argument checking may
or may not be embedded in compiled code, depending on the environment when the
code was generated.  If the code was generated while the @code{safety} optimize
level is zero (that is, while the value of @code{(proclamation '(optimize
(safety 0)))} is @true{}), then the generated code does not perform argument
checking at all.  Otherwise, the compiled code does check the validity of
arguments.

The @code{generic-function} macro creates an anonymous generic function. The
generic function is created with the set of methods specified by its method
descriptions.  The @var{option}, @var{method-qualifier}, and
@var{specialized-lambda-list} arguments are the same as for @code{defgeneric}.
The generic function object is returned as the result.  If no method
descriptions are specified, an anonymous generic function with no methods is
created.  See @macref{defgeneric}, @macref{generic-flet},
@macref{generic-labels}, @macref{defmethod}.

@deffn {Generic} {initialize-instance}  instance @rest{} initargs
@deffnx {Method} {initialize-instance} {(instance standard-object) @rest{} initargs}

The generic function @code{initialize-instance} is called by
@code{make-instance} to initialize a newly created instance.  The generic
function @code{initialize-instance} is called with the new instance and the
defaulted initialization arguments.
@end deffn

@defun {invalid-method-error} {method format-string @rest{} args}

The function @code{invalid-method-error} is used to signal an error when there
is an applicable method whose qualifiers are not valid for the method
combination type.  The error message is constructed by using a format string
and any arguments to it.  Because an implementation may need to add additional
contextual information to the error message, invalid-method-error should be
called only within the dynamic extent of a method combination function.  The
function invalid-method-error is called automatically when a method fails to
satisfy every qualifier pattern and predicate in a define-method-combination
form.  A method combination function that imposes additional restrictions
should call invalid-method-error explicitly if it encounters a method it cannot
accept.
@end defun

@deffn {Generic} {make-instance}  class @rest{}@var{ initargs}
@deffnx {Method} {make-instance} {(class standard-class) @rest{} initargs}
@deffnx {Method} {make-instance} {(class symbol) @rest{} initargs}

The generic function make-instance creates and returns a new instance of the
given class.  The generic function make-instance may be used as described in
section 1.9.  The class argument is a class object or a symbol that names a
class.  The remaining arguments form a list of alternating initialization
argument names and values.  If the second of the above methods is selected,
that method invokes make-instance on the arguments (find-class class) and
initargs.  The initialization arguments are checked within make-instance (see
section 1.9).  The new instance is returned.
@end deffn

@deffn {Generic} {make-instances-obsolete}  class
@deffnx {Method} {make-instances-obsolete} {(class standard-class)}
@deffnx {Method} {make-instances-obsolete} {(class symbol)}
@end deffn

@defun {method-combination-error} {format-string @rest{} args}

The function method-combination-error is used to signal an error in method
combination.  The error message is constructed by using a format string and any
arguments to it.  Because an implementation may need to add additional
contextual information to the error message, method-combination-error should be
called only within the dynamic extent of a method combination function.  The
format-string argument is a control string that can be given to format, and
args are any arguments required by that string.
@end defun

@deffn {Generic} {method-qualifiers}  method
@deffnx {Method} {method-qualifiers} {(method standard-method)}

The generic function method-qualifiers returns a list of the qualifiers
of the given method.
@end deffn

@defun {next-method-p} {}

The locally defined function next-method-p can be used within the body of a
method defined by a method-defining form to determine whether a next method
exists.
@end defun

@deffn {Generic} {no-applicable-method}  generic-function @rest{} function-arguments
@deffnx {Method} {no-applicable-method} {(generic-function t) @rest{} function-arguments}

The generic function no-applicable-method is called when a generic function of
the class standard-generic-function is invoked and no method on that generic
function is applicable. The default method signals an error.
@end deffn

@deffn {Generic} {no-next-method}  generic-function method @rest{} args
@deffnx {Method} {no-next-method} {(generic-function standard-generic-function) (method standard-method) @rest{} args}
@end deffn

@deffn {Generic} {print-object}  object stream
@deffnx {Method} {print-object} {(object standard-object) stream}

The generic function print-object writes the printed representation of an
object to a stream.  The function print-object is called by the print system;
it should not be called by the user.
@end deffn

@deffn {Generic} {reinitialize-instance}  instance @rest{} initargs
@deffnx {Method} {reinitialize-instance} {(instance standard-object) @rest{} initargs}

The generic function reinitialize-instance can be used to change the
values of local slots according to initialization arguments.  This
generic function is called by the Meta-Object Protocol.  It can also be
called by users.
@end deffn

@deffn {Generic} {remove-method}  generic-function method
@deffnx {Method} {remove-method} {(generic-function standard-generic-function) method}

The generic function remove-method removes a method from a generic function.
It destructively modifies the specified generic function and returns the
modified generic function as its result.
@end deffn

@deffn {Generic} {shared-initialize}  @var{instance slot-names @rest{} initargs}
@deffnx {Method} {shared-initialize} {(instance standard-object) slot-names @rest{} initargs}

The generic function shared-initialize is used to fill the slots of an instance
using initialization arguments and :initform forms.  It is called when an
instance is created, when an instance is re-initialized, when an instance is
updated to conform to a redefined class, and when an instance is updated to
conform to a different class.  The generic function @code{shared-initialize} is
called by the system-supplied primary method for @code{initialize-instance},
@code{reinitialize-instance}, @code{update-instance-for-redefined-class}, and
@code{update-instance-for-different-class}.
@end deffn

@defun {slot-boundp} {instance slot-name}

The function slot-boundp tests whether a specific slot in an instance is bound.
The arguments are the instance and the name of the slot.
@end defun

@defun {slot-exists-p} {object slot-name}

The function slot-exists-p tests whether the specified object has a slot of the
given name.  The object argument is any object.  The slot-name argument is a
symbol.
@end defun

@defun {slot-makunbound} {instance slot-name}

The function slot-makunbound restores a slot in an instance to the unbound
state.  The arguments to slot-makunbound are the instance and the name of the
slot.
@end defun

@deffn {Generic} {slot-missing}  class object slot-name operation @optional{} new-value
@deffnx {Method} {slot-missing} {(class t) object slot-name operation @optional{} new-value}

The generic function slot-missing is invoked when an attempt is made to access
a slot in an object whose metaclass is standard-class and the name of the slot
provided is not a name of a slot in that class.  The default method signals an
error.
@end deffn

@deffn {Generic} {slot-unbound}  class instance slot-name
@deffnx {Method} {slot-unbound} {(class t) instance slot-name}

The generic function slot-unbound is called when an unbound slot is read in an
instance whose metaclass is standard-class. The default method signals an
error.
@end deffn

@defun {slot-value} {object slot-name}

The function slot-value returns the value contained in the slot slot-name of
the given object.  If there is no slot with that name, slot-missing is called.
If the slot is unbound, slot-unbound is called.  The macro setf can be used
with slot-value to change the value of a slot.
@end defun

@deffn {Generic} {update-instance-for-different-class}  previous current @rest{} initargs
@deffnx {Method} {update-instance-for-different-class} {(previous standard-object) (currentstandard-object) @rest{} initargs}
@end deffn

@deffn {Generic} {update-instance-for-redefined-class}  instance added-slots discarded-slots property-list @rest{} initargs
@deffnx {Method} {update-instance-for-redefined-class} {(instance standard-object) added-slots discarded-slots property-list @rest{} initargs}
@end deffn

@defmac {with-accessors} {(@{slot-entry@}*) instance-form @{declaration@}* @{form@}*}

The macro with-accessors creates a lexical environment in which specified slots
are lexically available through their accessors as if they were variables.  The
macro with-accessors invokes the appropriate accessors to access the specified
slots.  Both setf and setq can be used to set the value of the slot.  The
result returned is that obtained by executing the forms specified by the body
argument.
@end defmac

@defmac {with-slots} {(@{slot-entry@}*) instance-form @{declaration@}* @{form@}*}
@example
@var{slot-entry} ::= @var{slot-name} | (@var{variable-name} @var{slot-name})
@end example

The macro @code{with-slots} creates a lexical context for referring to
specified slots as though they were variables.  Within such a context the value
of the slot can be specified by using its slot name, as if it were a lexically
bound variable.  Both @code{setf} and @code{setq} can be used to set the value
of the slot.
